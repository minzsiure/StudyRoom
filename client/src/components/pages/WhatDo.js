                Our mission is to create an enjoyable study environment. Join your customized study room with a cute bear study buddy! 

Over quarantine or even during normal times, we feel the need to work alone sometimes to keep ourselves focused. Here, we provide a website *with a cute bear* to give you some company. When you make progress on your plan, you will earn honey to make your bear happier and cuter. If you are distracted from entertainments such as YouTube - uh oh - the bear will be sad and your progress may be lost. Of course, the bear will remind you to take a break and drink some water as it deeply cares about your health.
